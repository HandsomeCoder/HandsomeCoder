I am a backbencher who has accomplished a few things so far!

I have 4+ years of product development and engineering experience.

Time is everything to me and I am always ready to take ownership of tasks and drive them to completion within committed timelines.

My core work areas are designing architecture with proper design patterns, developing reliable functionalities to enhance usability, scaling large systems to maintain performance, and delivering solutions quickly using DevOps automation.
